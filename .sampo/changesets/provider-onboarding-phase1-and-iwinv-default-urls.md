Formalize provider onboarding specs and add CLI doctor/preflight flow for AlimTalk readiness checks.

Introduce provider onboarding registry metadata, plusId policy enforcement for ALIMTALK send, and opt-in provider live integration workflow scaffolding.

Lock IWINV endpoint handling to built-in defaults (no base URL env/config overrides) and remove those fields from CLI/provider examples and docs.
